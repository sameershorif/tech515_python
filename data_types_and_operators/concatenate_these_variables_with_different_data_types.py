# Your starting code:

x = 2
y = 5.4
z = " there's now a number 25.4 unless we put a space in!"

print(str(x) + str(y) + z)

# The problem: Python can’t combine "+" different data types (e.g., int/float + str).
# The solution: Use the str() function to convert numbers to strings before concatenating.
