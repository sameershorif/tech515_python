# Starting code:
# bad_string = 'I said 'Wow!''
# print(bad_string)

# This fails because Python thinks the string ends at the second
# ', right before Wow! causing a Syntax Error.

# Best version
good_string = "I said 'Wow!'"
print(good_string)

# good_string = 'I said \'Wow!\''
# print(good_string)
#
# good_string = '''I said 'Wow!' '''
# print(good_string)

# Best practice:
# Use single quotes ' ' and double quotes " " interchangeably, depending on which makes your string
# easier to read.
