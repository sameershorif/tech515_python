# Intro to Version Control and Git

## Version Control System

### What is a Version Control System (VCS)

* A system that helps track/manage/save/record changes to a file or set of files over time, so that we can recall a specific version later.

### Benefits
* revert changes back
* compare changes
* View who made changes and when
* Able to accept changes

### Types of version control


#### What is manual version control

* when you make a copy of a file with an updated name

#### How did early version control systems work

* Tracked changes to individual files 
* Base file to start, then each version of the file saved a delta.
* to get lastest version, had to use base file + all deltas

#### Centralised VCS vs Distributed VCS like Git


## Local Version Control with Git


### What is stored in each version of a file that changes

* store the snapshot of the whole file that has been changed
* 

### Does Git need to be used as a distributed VCS

* No, but it should be so you can have easy access to it and have a backup, also to facilitate teamwork

### What does Git store in a 'commit'



### The three states in Git

* Modified 
* Staged
* Commited

### Where does Git store its information
* .git 


### Common workflow of Git commands
